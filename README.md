# Household-Power-Consumption
## Introduction
With the advent of new gadgets and a push towards greater electrification projects globally, power consumption is rising globally. 

Thus, we can also expect that household or residential power consumption is so on the rise. With greater access to global power consumption data, forecasting power consumption is an emerging challenge.

An accurate forecast can help both the consumer as well as the supplier side. For the consumer, a power forecast helps in financial planning as making more green choices overall. For the supplier, an accurate forecast will definitely help in supply regulation. Thus, such models can help to optimize the overall supply chain of the household power industry.

## Project Goal:

<strong> Track the power consumption of individual households in almost real time. </strong>
